Macros to be used in the CAE mode of Simulia Abaqus

You should place both abaqusMacros.py and config_macros files in your Work directory.

config_macros file is used to mofify behaviour of macros scripts, present in abaqusMacros.py.

You can modify config variables on the fly, by saving changes on config_macros and then hitting the Reload button in
the File->Macro manager dialog box on the GUI.

Looking forward to keep including new actions.

Thanks four your attention.
